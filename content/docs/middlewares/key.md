## fnrunner Key
`fnrun.middleware/key`

## Configuration
The key middleware requires a string input that names the key to be selected
from the input. A common case would be to select the body from an http input.

## Examples
The following example demonstrates how to select the body key from the input
map generated by the http input.

```yaml
source: 
  fnrun.source/http:
    treatOutputAsBody: true
middleware:
  - fnrun.middleware/key: body
fn: fnrun.fn/identity
```
